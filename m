Doh, of course. I saw "pending requests" and
somehow imagined it would wait for the runtime_put.

I see now that these patches are the way to go.

OK, I agree. We need to fix this issue then,
changing the order of the calls.

Currently, it's only used by imx8mq, and it's enclosed
by clk_bulk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare.

I am quite sure the prepare/unprepare usage is an oversight
on our side, but it doesn't do any harm either.

Moving the clock handling to hantro_runtime_resume is possible,
but looks like just low-hanging fruit.

I can try to fix the above clk/pm issue and take this helper
on the same series, if that's useful.
