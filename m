FYI, I sent a v3 here: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11331373/
that addresses _some_ of these concerns.

I'm not quite sure how to describe the regulators in a way that we can
check that the device tree does not specific extra ones (apart from
doing some string matching on all properties?), and I don't think I'm
best placed to implement the soft-PDC idea. See my comment on that
patch.

Thanks!
