Well, this still sounds a bit vague to me. I need to understand more
exactly under what circumstances the problem occurs.

What platform are you testing with and what SDIO card is being used?

Is the problem happening during the system resume phase?

Are the SDIO func driver using runtime PM and then is the host capable
of MMC_CAP_POWER_OFF_CARD?

Is it easy to reproduce the problem for you?

Thanks for sharing these details! I think we need to continue to debug
this issue, to fully understand.

In principle, it sounds to me that maybe mmc_power_cycle(), isn't
really successfully power-cycling the SDIO card. Perhaps insert a few
delays or so in that code to see how that would affect things?

Anyway, how is the power to the SDIO card controlled in this case? Are
you using a mmc-pwrseq?

I have a few patches in the pipe, which fixes some other problems in
mmc_sdio_init_card(). Possibly those can be related, but I need a day
or so to post them, let's see.

Kind regards
