I would much prefer mac_link_up to be used for setting the speed,
duplex and pause modes for future-proofing in all cases except for
the case where these parameters are automatically updated in the
MAC from its associated PCS.

mac_link_up must not be used to configure the AN mode or interface
mode; these must be configured in mac_config().

I do have further changes that split the PCS ops from the MAC ops, so
what is in this series is not the full story yet - some of the further
patches can be found in my "phy" branch and "cex7" branches where I add
support to dpaa2 for automatically switching between SGMII and
1000BASE-X.  dpaa2 is one of these split PCS/MAC setups, but with the
extra complication that there's a firmware layer between the PCS and
MAC.

However, this series is the first stand-alone step along the road to
supporting split PCS/MAC setups in a sane manner.

I discussed with Andrew Lunn how much to send, and the conclusion was
to make the changes in a number of small patch series, as large patch
series tend not to get reviewed.  My experience with _this_ series is
that even this is very difficult to get feedback for, so adding any
additional patches will just make that worse.

In this case, mac_link_up doesn't do anything with the speed/duplex/
pause stuff when those are automatically passed from the PCS.

I'm afraid that sentence contains a subtlety that's going to get
people: it is not clear cut because of the different natures of the
various links.

In 1000BASE-X, speed is fixed at 1G, and the PCS autonegotiates the
duplex and pause with the remote end.  For mvneta (an example of a
combined PCS/MAC implementation) operating in-band:
- In mac_config():
  - configures for 1000BASE-X interface type with in-band AN.
  - configures fixed 1G.
  - As mvneta only supports full duplex, we disable duplex negotiation
    and force full duplex.
  - Only symmetric pause is supported, and we set the symmetric pause
    advertisement appropriately, with pause negotiation enabled.
- In mac_link_up():
  - merely allow the device to transmit and receive.

The MAC will be forced to 1G, full duplex, and will automatically be
configured by the PCS for pause support depending on the hardware
based pause resolution.

The situation is different for SGMII operating in-band:
- In mac_config():
  - configures for SGMII interface type with in-band AN.
  - configures speed and duplex negotiation.
  - disables pause negotiation; SGMII has no support for this.
- In mac_link_up():
  - enables or disables pause frames depending on the tx_pause/
    rx_pause flags, since this is not available from the MAC.
  - allow the device to transmit and receive.

If we aren't operating in in-band mode, then:
- In mac_config():
  - configures for the interface type without in-band AN.
  - disables speed, duplex and pause negotiation.
- In mac_link_up():
  - sets the speed, duplex and pause frames depending on the passed
    parameters.
  - allow the device to transmit and receive.

Please see patch 7 of this series which implements this for mvneta.

So, there is a split between what mac_config() should be doing and what
mac_link_up() should be doing; this is why I've said in the
documentation that the "mode" and "interface" are for reference only in
mac_link_up() - mac_link_up() can use these to decide _how_ to program
the resolved parameters, but should _not_ use them to determine the
link configuration (such as changing the interface between SGMII and
1000BASE-X - that is the responsibility of mac_config().)

I hope that helps clarify the situation.
